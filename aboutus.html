                                    <p>Brian Elias is founder and president of 1-800-HANSONS, DontGo, several incubating software ventures and a potpourri of businesses, including a maze company and a large domain reseller.<br /> <br /> 

                                    Elias established his reputation as a brilliant entrepreneur by founding 1-800-HANSONS and building it into a $75 million home improvement and remodeling company headquartered in Troy, MI. Elias started the company in 1988 and has grown it to be one of the 10 largest home improvement companies in the US, employing more than 500 people.<br /> <br />

                                    Elias was named The Fred Case Entrepreneur of the Year in 2012, primarily for the advances he has achieved in technology, which include computerized canvassing, mobile appointment setting and a 1-800-HANSONS monitoring station or “command center” as it is referred to internally.<br /> <br /> 

                                    Since starting in business in 1988, Elias has worked to share a common company culture with customers and employees alike. "Our strategy is not complex: put the customer first utilizing a team of dedicated people that ‘Get it Done.’ After all, that is the ultimate scorecard; we either got it done for our customers or we didn't."<br /><br />

                                    Giving back to the community remains a priority for Elias. Whether for local groups such as Rebuilding Together Oakland County, Grace Charities of Hope, Covenant House or local chapters of national charities including Relay for Life, Breast Cancer Awareness, Habitat for Humanity, ORT and several Jewish organizations. Elias has been active and generous with both donations and his personal time.</p>

                        <h4>David L. Wigler Executive Biography</h4>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-sm-12">
                               <div class="pull-left"><img src="assets/img/dave.png"/></div>
                               <!-- <div class="pull-left"> -->
                                    <p>David Wigler is a serial entrepreneur and a veteran of 25 years in the technology industry.  <br /> <br /> 

                                    Wigler’s reputation was established early in his career, as the North American Sales Leader for R&H and a member of the leadership team responsible for helping R&H go public as Brain AG on the Neuer Stock Exchange in Frankfort.<br /> <br />

                                    Wigler followed that up with executive leadership positions in helping Best Software get acquired by Sage, Fastech get acquired by Kronos and Workscape get acquired by ADP.  His specialty is helping small technology start-ups define their markets, establish strong relationships with their customers, grow quickly and exponentially and become valuable and viable companies within their space.<br /> <br />

                                    Wigler has managed sales teams from as small as five individuals to teams over 100 salespeople and has exceeded quotas beyond $50M per year.  Wigler is described by those who work for him as a manic tinkerer who is inspiring as a leader but always willing to roll up his sleeves and do whatever work is necessary to get the job done.  <br /> <br />

                                    Wigler is excited to be part of DontGo as he sees the Chat Industry as ripe for disruption.  “Everyone has chat and yet no one likes to use it,” Wigler says.  “Think about it.  Our brain functions like a super computer, and yet when you click the CHAT button on a website, you wait for upwards of a minute to get an answer and then the answer is typically something more designed to ensure the chat software company gets paid than to provide topical content to the prospect.  I cannot think of another Billion dollar industry where everyone uses the technology, yet everyone knows they are providing poor customer service in its use.”<br /> <br />

                                    Wigler believes DontGo’s revolutionary AI combined with patented capture technology will completely recreate this industry and produce immediate, measurable financial rewards for anyone who uses the technology.</p>
